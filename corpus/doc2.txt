Following the amalgamation of the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd, Abdulaziz issued a royal decree on 23 September 1932 naming the new state al-Mamlaka al-ʿArabiyya as-Suʿūdiyya (Arabic المملكة العربية السعودية ), which is normally translated as "the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia" in English,[37] but literally means "the Saudi Arab Kingdom",[38] or "the Saudi Kingdom of Arabia" (compare the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan).

The word "Saudi" is derived from the element as-Suʿūdīyya in the Arabic name of the country, which is a type of adjective known as a nisba, formed from the dynastic name of the Saudi royal family, the Al Saud (Arabic: آل سعود). Its inclusion expresses the view that the country is the personal possession of the royal family.[39][40] Al Saud is an Arabic name formed by adding the word Al, meaning "family of" or "House of",[41] to the personal name of an ancestor. In the case of Al Saud, this is Saud ibn Muhammad ibn Muqrin, the father of the dynasty's 18th-century founder, Muhammad bin Saud.[42]
